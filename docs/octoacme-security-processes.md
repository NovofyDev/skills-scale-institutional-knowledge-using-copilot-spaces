## Security Review Process

### When Security Reviews Are Required

- **Code Review**: For changes to security-critical components
- **Pre-Release**: For all releases to production
- **Dependency Updates**: For major dependency changes or security patches
- **Infrastructure Changes**: For changes to deployment or access controls

### Security Review Checklist

#### Design Review (Led by Security Lead)
- [ ] Threat model documented for new features
- [ ] Authentication and authorization mechanisms defined
- [ ] Data classification and protection requirements identified
- [ ] Compliance requirements reviewed (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- [ ] Security controls documented in design
- [ ] Privacy impact assessed

#### Code Security Review (Security Lead + Developers)
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Secrets and credentials not hardcoded
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Security headers configured correctly
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] SAST (Static Application Security Testing) results reviewed

#### Pre-Release Security Sign-off (Security Lead)
- [ ] All security scans passing (no critical/high vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Penetration testing completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Security monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Incident response procedures updated
- [ ] Security runbook reviewed and current
- [ ] Access controls verified
- [ ] Security training completed for new features

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Exploitable remotely, leads to system compromise or data breach
- **High**: Exploitable with user interaction, significant data exposure
- **Medium**: Limited exploitation potential, requires privileged access
- **Low**: Theoretical risk, minimal business impact

### Remediation SLAs
- **Critical**: Immediate response, fix within 24 hours
- **High**: Fix within 7 days
- **Medium**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low**: Fix in next regular release or within 90 days

### Vulnerability Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated scans, security research, bug bounty reports
2. **Triage** (Security Lead):
   - Verify vulnerability and assess severity
   - Determine affected systems and user impact
   - Assign owner and remediation timeline
3. **Remediation** (Developer + Security Lead):
   - Develop and test fix
   - Security Lead validates fix effectiveness
   - Deploy according to severity SLA
4. **Verification** (QA Lead + Security Lead):
   - Confirm vulnerability resolved
   - Run regression tests
   - Update security documentation
5. **Communication** (Release Manager + Stakeholder Rep):
   - Notify affected users if needed
   - Update security advisories
   - Document lessons learned

## Security Incident Response

### Incident Types
- **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Service Compromise**: System takeover or unauthorized access
- **DDoS/Availability**: Service disruption attacks
- **Malware/Intrusion**: Malicious code or unauthorized system access
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious or accidental insider actions

### Incident Response Phases

#### 1. Detection & Alert
- Automated security monitoring triggers alert
- Security Lead or on-call engineer notified
- Initial assessment: Is this a security incident?

#### 2. Containment (within 1 hour)
**Security Lead coordinates:**
- [ ] Isolate affected systems to prevent spread
- [ ] Preserve evidence (logs, snapshots, memory dumps)
- [ ] Block malicious IPs/accounts if identified
- [ ] Notify incident response team
- [ ] Page additional responders if needed
- [ ] Create incident war room/channel

#### 3. Investigation & Analysis
**Incident Response Team:**
- [ ] Determine attack vector and timeline
- [ ] Identify compromised systems and data
- [ ] Assess scope and impact
- [ ] Collect forensic evidence
- [ ] Document all findings in incident log

#### 4. Eradication & Recovery
- [ ] Remove malicious code/access
- [ ] Patch vulnerabilities exploited
- [ ] Reset compromised credentials
- [ ] Restore from clean backups if needed
- [ ] Verify systems clean before restore
- [ ] Security Lead approves systems for production

#### 5. Post-Incident Activities
- [ ] Conduct blameless post-mortem within 48 hours
- [ ] Document timeline and root cause
- [ ] Create prevention action items
- [ ] Update incident response procedures
- [ ] Notify affected users/customers (if applicable)
- [ ] File compliance reports (if required)
- [ ] Share lessons learned with team

### Incident Communication

#### Internal Communication (Security Lead)
- **Immediate**: Notify incident response team, Release Manager, on-call
- **Hourly**: Status updates to leadership during active incident
- **Resolution**: Summary of incident, impact, and remediation

#### External Communication (Stakeholder Rep + Security Lead)
- **Customer Impact**: Notify within 4 hours if customer data affected
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinate with legal/PR team
- **Regulatory**: File required breach notifications per regulations

### Incident Severity Levels

**SEV-1 (Critical)**
- Active data breach or system compromise
- Widespread service outage from security event
- Response: Immediate all-hands response

**SEV-2 (High)**
- Contained security breach
- Targeted attack on specific systems
- Response: Security Lead + incident response team

**SEV-3 (Medium)**
- Suspicious activity under investigation
- Potential vulnerability being exploited
- Response: Security Lead monitoring, may escalate

**SEV-4 (Low)**
- Security alert requiring investigation
- Non-critical security findings
- Response: Track and investigate during business hours

## Security Escalation Paths

### Standard Escalation
1. **Detection**: Automated alert or manual report
2. **On-call Engineer**: Initial triage and containment
3. **Security Lead**: Coordinate response and investigation
4. **Product Lead**: If business-impacting decisions needed
5. **Executive Team**: For critical incidents or data breaches

### Emergency Escalation
- **Critical Security Incident**: Security Lead can escalate directly to executive team
- **Active Data Breach**: Immediate notification to Legal and PR teams
- **Regulatory Concern**: Immediate notification to Compliance team

### Contact Chain (maintained by Security Lead)
- On-call rotation: [Link to PagerDuty/on-call schedule]
- Security Lead: [Contact info]
- Product Lead: [Contact info]
- Legal Team: [Contact info]
- PR/Communications: [Contact info]

**Maintenance Requirements**:
- Update contact information monthly or when personnel changes
- Test contact chain quarterly to ensure accuracy
- Security Lead owns maintaining this list
- Backup contacts should be designated for each role
