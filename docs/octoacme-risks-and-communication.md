# OctoAcme â€” Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication

### Identifying Stakeholders
Stakeholder groups and their communication needs:

| Stakeholder Group | Primary Contact | Communication Frequency | Channel |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------|
| Engineering Team | Project Manager | Daily | Standup, Slack |
| Product Leadership | Product Manager | Weekly | Status meeting |
| Sales Team | Stakeholder Rep | Milestone-based | Email updates |
| Support Team | Stakeholder Rep | Per release | Release notes |
| Executive Sponsors | Project Manager | Monthly | Executive summary |
| Customers/Users | Stakeholder Rep | Per release | Product announcements |

### Stakeholder Communication Plan
- **Establish Early**: Identify stakeholders during project initiation
- **Tailor Messages**: Customize content and detail level per audience
- **Be Proactive**: Don't wait for stakeholders to ask for updates
- **Use Single Source of Truth**: Maintain status in project README or dashboard
- **Set Expectations**: Define update frequency and format upfront

### Stakeholder Feedback Loop Process
1. **Gather Feedback**:
   - Stakeholder Representative collects input from stakeholder groups
   - QA Lead coordinates user acceptance testing
   - Product Manager conducts user research and validation
   
2. **Consolidate & Prioritize** (weekly):
   - Stakeholder Representative presents feedback in planning meeting
   - Product Manager assesses impact and priority
   - Project Manager tracks feedback items
   
3. **Act & Communicate**:
   - Team addresses high-priority feedback
   - Stakeholder Representative communicates decisions back to stakeholders
   - Close the loop: "Here's what we heard and what we're doing about it"
   
4. **Measure Effectiveness**:
   - Track feedback response time
   - Monitor stakeholder satisfaction
   - Review feedback loop in retrospectives

## Escalation Paths

### Standard Escalation Levels
**Level 1 - Team Escalation**:
- **When**: Issues team can resolve independently
- **Process**: Raised in daily standup, assigned owner
- **Timeline**: Resolve within sprint
- **Escalate if**: Not resolved in 3 days or impacts sprint goal

**Level 2 - Project Management Escalation**:
- **When**: Cross-team dependencies, resource conflicts, missed deadlines
- **Owner**: Project Manager coordinates resolution
- **Involves**: Product Manager for priority decisions
- **Timeline**: Decision within 2 business days
- **Escalate if**: Impacts release timeline or requires executive decision

**Level 3 - Leadership Escalation**:
- **When**: Business-impacting decisions, significant delays, budget needs
- **Owner**: Product Lead coordinates with stakeholders
- **Involves**: Executive sponsor, relevant VPs
- **Timeline**: Decision within 1 week
- **Escalate if**: Requires board approval or affects company commitments

### Security Incident Escalation
- **Security Issues**: Follow security incident runbook (see octoacme-security-processes.md)
- **Point of Contact**: Security Lead (primary), on-call engineer (backup)
- **Immediate Escalation**: Critical vulnerabilities or active breaches go directly to Security Lead
- **After Hours**: Page Security on-call immediately for SEV-1/SEV-2 incidents

### Quality Escalation
- **Quality Gates Failed**: QA Lead blocks release, escalates to Release Manager
- **Critical Defects**: QA Lead escalates to Project Manager and Product Manager
- **Release Decision**: If disagreement on release readiness, Release Manager escalates to Product Lead

### Cross-Functional Escalation Matrix

| Issue Type | First Contact | Escalate To | Final Authority |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Technical blocker | Developer lead | Project Manager | Product Lead |
| Quality concern | QA Lead | Release Manager | Product Lead |
| Security issue | Security Lead | Product Lead | CISO/Executive |
| Dependency delay | Project Manager | Product Manager | Product Lead |
| Resource conflict | Project Manager | Product Lead | Executive Sponsor |
| Stakeholder conflict | Stakeholder Rep | Product Manager | Product Lead |
| Release decision | Release Manager | Product Lead | Executive Sponsor |
| Scope change | Product Manager | Product Lead | Executive Sponsor |

### Escalation Best Practices
- **Document First**: Capture the issue, impact, and options before escalating
- **Provide Context**: Include timeline, stakeholders affected, and decision deadline
- **Propose Solutions**: Come with recommendations, not just problems
- **Be Timely**: Don't wait until last minute to escalate
- **Follow Up**: After escalation decision, communicate outcome to all affected parties
- **Track Patterns**: Review escalations in retrospectives to improve processes
