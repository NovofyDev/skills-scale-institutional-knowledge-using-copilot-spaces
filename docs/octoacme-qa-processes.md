# OctoAcme — QA Processes & Quality Ownership

## Purpose
Define quality assurance processes, testing standards, and QA sign-off procedures to ensure high-quality deliverables.

---

## Quality Ownership Model

### Shared Quality Responsibility
Quality is everyone's responsibility, with defined ownership at each stage:

- **Developers**: Own quality of code they write (unit tests, code review)
- **QA Lead**: Owns overall quality strategy and testing processes
- **Product Managers**: Own acceptance criteria and user experience quality
- **Release Manager**: Owns release quality and deployment readiness
- **Security Lead**: Owns security quality and vulnerability management

### QA Lead Responsibilities by Phase

#### Planning Phase
- Review acceptance criteria for testability
- Define test strategy and approach
- Identify test data and environment needs
- Estimate testing effort and timeline
- Define quality metrics and goals

#### Development Phase
- Review test plans with developers
- Guide test automation development
- Conduct exploratory testing on early builds
- Track defect trends and quality metrics
- Provide early feedback on quality concerns

#### Testing Phase
- Execute or coordinate test execution
- Manage defect triage and prioritization
- Report quality status and risks
- Validate defect fixes
- Ensure test coverage meets standards

#### Release Phase
- Provide quality sign-off for releases
- Validate release readiness
- Coordinate user acceptance testing
- Review production monitoring setup
- Participate in go/no-go decision

## Test Strategy & Planning

### Test Levels

#### Unit Testing (Developer ownership)
- **Coverage Goal**: >80% line coverage for new code (branch coverage recommended at >70%)
- **Scope**: Individual functions and methods
- **When**: During development, before PR
- **Automated**: Yes, runs in CI

#### Integration Testing (Developer + QA Lead)
- **Coverage Goal**: All major integration points
- **Scope**: Component interactions, API contracts
- **When**: After component completion
- **Automated**: Yes, runs in CI

#### System Testing (QA Lead ownership)
- **Coverage Goal**: All critical user workflows
- **Scope**: End-to-end functionality
- **When**: Feature-complete builds
- **Automated**: Critical paths automated, exploratory testing manual

#### User Acceptance Testing (Stakeholder Rep + QA Lead)
- **Coverage Goal**: Key user scenarios and workflows
- **Scope**: Business requirements validation
- **When**: Before release to production
- **Automated**: No, human validation required

#### Performance Testing (QA Lead + Developers)
- **Coverage Goal**: Critical performance scenarios
- **Scope**: Load, stress, scalability testing
- **When**: Before major releases or architecture changes
- **Automated**: Yes, baseline tests in CI

#### Security Testing (Security Lead + QA Lead)
- **Coverage Goal**: OWASP Top 10 coverage

## Testing Handoff Process

### Development → QA Handoff
**Developer Responsibilities**:
1. Mark feature as "Ready for QA" in project board
2. Provide QA handoff notes:
   - What changed and why
   - How to test the feature
   - Test data needed
   - Known limitations or edge cases
   - Links to PRs and documentation
3. Ensure CI passing and code reviewed
4. Demo feature to QA Lead if complex

**QA Lead Acceptance**:
- [ ] Feature meets Definition of Done
- [ ] Test environment accessible
- [ ] Test data available
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clear
- [ ] No critical CI failures

If handoff criteria not met, QA Lead returns to developer with feedback.

### QA → Release Manager Handoff
**QA Lead Responsibilities**:
1. Complete all testing per test plan
2. Provide QA sign-off (see template below)
3. Ensure all P0/P1 defects resolved
4. Report quality metrics
5. Document known issues for release notes

**Release Manager Acceptance**:
- Reviews QA sign-off
- Assesses remaining risks
- Determines if quality bar met for release

## Defect Management

### Defect Priority Definitions

**P0 - Critical**
- **Impact**: System down, data loss, security breach
- **Examples**: App crashes on launch, data corruption, authentication broken
- **Response**: Immediate fix required, may block release
- **Owner**: Developer assigned immediately

**P1 - High**
- **Impact**: Major feature broken, significant user impact
- **Examples**: Core workflow fails, major performance degradation
- **Response**: Fix before release or provide workaround
- **Owner**: Assigned to developer, tracked daily

**P2 - Medium**
- **Impact**: Feature partially broken, minor user impact
- **Examples**: Edge case failures, UI glitches, minor performance issues
- **Response**: Fix in current or next release
- **Owner**: Assigned and tracked in backlog

**P3 - Low**
- **Impact**: Cosmetic issues, nice-to-have improvements
- **Examples**: Typos, alignment issues, minor UX improvements
- **Response**: Fix when convenient, may defer
- **Owner**: Tracked in backlog

### Defect Triage Process

**Daily Defect Triage** (for active testing):
- **When**: Daily during testing phase
- **Who**: QA Lead + Developer Lead + Project Manager
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes
- **Agenda**:
  1. Review new defects from last 24 hours
  2. Assign priority and severity
  3. Assign owner
  4. Estimate fix effort
  5. Determine if release blocker

**Triage Decision Matrix**:
| Priority | Severity High | Severity Medium | Severity Low |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P0 | Fix immediately | Fix before release | Fix before release |
| P1 | Fix before release | Fix before release | Fix in next release |
| P2 | Fix in current release | Fix in next release | Backlog |
| P3 | Fix in next release | Backlog | Backlog |

### Defect Workflow
1. **Reported**: QA Lead creates defect with reproduction steps
2. **Triaged**: Priority and owner assigned
3. **In Progress**: Developer working on fix
4. **Ready for Verification**: Fix deployed to test environment
5. **Verified**: QA Lead confirms fix works
6. **Closed**: Defect resolved
