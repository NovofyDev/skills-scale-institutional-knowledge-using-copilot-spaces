# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme uses a structured project management approach to deliver product features and improvements. Our process is built on several key principles:

- **Customer-first thinking**: We prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to enable faster feedback and adaptation
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead to ensure accountability
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback and learning in a blame-free environment

### Key Workflows

Our project lifecycle follows a structured approach:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish a high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Determine scope, allocate resources, set milestones, and identify dependencies
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate on features with continuous monitoring
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Personas & Roles

OctoAcme projects involve clearly defined roles to ensure effective collaboration:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

### Communication Strategies

We maintain consistent communication through:

- **Weekly syncs** between PM and PdM to align on priorities and blockers
- **Twice-weekly standups** for the delivery team (or as agreed by the team)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** to keep leadership and cross-functional teams informed
- **Ad-hoc escalations** for urgent issues that require immediate attention
- **Risk registers** to track and communicate project risks and mitigation plans

### Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is maintained through:

- **Clear acceptance criteria** and definition of done for all features
- **Comprehensive testing** including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing
- **Code reviews** and design collaboration to ensure maintainability
- **Risk identification and mitigation** throughout the project lifecycle
- **Retrospectives** to continuously improve processes and outcomes

### Key Artifacts

We use standardized artifacts to maintain consistency:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
